Data Visualization – Distribution Analysis

This project focuses on visualizing the distribution of a continuous variable using the Global Student Migration dataset. The dataset captures various attributes of students migrating internationally, including salary expectations and destination countries.

Objective

The goal is to visualize the distribution of a key variable in a clear and interpretable way. A histogram was used for a continuous variable, while a bar chart was used for a categorical one. This approach helps highlight trends, concentrations, and irregularities in the dataset.

Dataset: Global Student Migration

The dataset provides insights into student migration patterns, including:
Starting salaries of students.
The countries where students are destined to work.
The students' demographic and migration-related attributes.
Graph Choices and Adjustments

Histogram – Starting Salaries

A histogram was created to explore the distribution of starting salaries. This visualization revealed:

A near-uniform shape with some noticeable inconsistencies.
A peak indicates a high number of students earning a specific salary level.
Minimal variability across bins and no extreme outliers.
A large range, signifying disparity in the students' starting salaries.
This suggests a stable distribution, possibly due to controlled recruitment or standardized salary offers.

Bar Chart – Destination Countries

A bar chart was used to show the distribution of students across 10 destination countries. To improve readability:

The y-axis was manually adjusted to start from 470.
This enhanced the visual clarity of small differences that would otherwise be flattened with a y-axis starting at 0.
This technique is commonly used when variations are subtle but meaningful.
Interpretation

The visualizations suggest:

Most starting salaries cluster within a wide range.
Student destinations are relatively balanced across countries with slight variations.
No major outliers were observed, supporting the idea of consistency in the data.
These visual tools help uncover underlying patterns that may support further decision-making or analysis on student migration trends.
